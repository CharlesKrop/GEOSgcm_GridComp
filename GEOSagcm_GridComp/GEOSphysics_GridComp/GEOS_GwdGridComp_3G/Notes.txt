Leaf components

1. Use a StateSpecs config file to specify import/export quantities.
   - much easier to maintain
   - reduced huge amounts of tedious boiler plate in the source code
   - tool will be created to convert to yaml for interaction with other
     layers

2. Use CF standard names
   - important for future interoperability with NUOPC
   - long names are not the same as standard names, but can be similar

3. Use the new timers.  No need to initialize in set services.  Just
   add start/stop around surrounding code.
   - note that timers for init/run/finalize are automatic

4. Use `_RC` macro:
```
   call foo(..., _RC)
```
instead of
```
   call foo(..., rc=status)
   _VERIFY(status)
```

5. Review inline documentation
   - check that it is correct
   - delete comments that do not add any real value

6. Avoid REAL*4 and REAL*8 - these are nonstandard.

   - `realk(kind=4)` and `real(kind=8)` are stndard conforming but
      make non portable assumptions.  Best to use named constants
      derived from KIND(1.) and KIND(1.d0).



Minor/miscellaneous
===================
1. GridComp directory is  GEOS_GwdGridComp rather than GEOSgwd_GridComp.
   The older form was a mistake that got propagated early on.  Time to fix.
2. Consider droppig "Mod" suffix from both file name and module name.
   - pretty much redundant information
3. Do not reference low-level MAPL modules directly.   using the MAPL module \
   is the best way to insulate code against internal structural changes in MAPL.
   - Do we want to make an exception for Contsants?
   - Do we want to start having users get the constants via procedures (prep for
     using dictionary)?
4. Consider introducing derived types to simplify internal interfaces.
   - Are structs preferable to long argument lists?
5. Consider using lower case variable names.  Esp. for local variables.  No shouting.




Parent components
=================

1. Use a ConnectivitySpecs file to specify:
   - child components (DSO)
   - connectivities
   - re-export
